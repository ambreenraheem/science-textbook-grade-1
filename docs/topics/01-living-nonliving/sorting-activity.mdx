# Sorting Living and Non-living Things

Now you know about living and non-living things! Let's practice telling them apart!

## How to Sort

Follow these steps to tell if something is living or non-living:

### Step 1: Ask "Can it grow?"
- If YES → Might be living!
- If NO → Might be non-living!

### Step 2: Ask "Does it need food?"
- If YES → Might be living!
- If NO → Might be non-living!

### Step 3: Ask "Can it move by itself?"
- If YES → Might be living!
- If NO → Might be non-living!

### Step 4: Ask "Can it have babies?"
- If YES → It's living! ✓
- If NO → It's non-living! ✓

## Tricky Questions!

### "Is the sun alive?"

The sun is bright and gives us light, but:
- It doesn't eat food ❌

- It's not a living thing!

**The sun is NON-LIVING, but it helps living things!**

Yes! Seeds are living things because:
- They can grow into plants ✓
- They need water ✓

**Seeds are LIVING!**
