# Sorting Living and Non-living Things

Now you know about living and non-living things! Let's practice telling them apart!

## How to Sort

Follow these steps to tell if something is living or non-living:

### Step 1: Ask "Can it grow?"
- If YES → Might be living!
- If NO → Might be non-living!

### Step 2: Ask "Does it need food?"
- If YES → Might be living!
- If NO → Might be non-living!

### Step 3: Ask "Can it move by itself?"
- If YES → Might be living!
- If NO → Might be non-living!

### Step 4: Ask "Can it have babies?"
- If YES → It's living! ✓
- If NO → It's non-living! ✓
