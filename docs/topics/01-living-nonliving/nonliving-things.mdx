# Non-living Things Around Us

Now that you know about living things, let's learn about **non-living things**!

## What Are Non-living Things?

Non-living things are things that are **NOT alive**. They cannot do the 5 signs of life.

:::note Remember
Living things can: grow, eat, breathe, move, and have babies.
Non-living things CANNOT do these things!
:::

## Examples of Non-living Things

### Around Your Home 🏠

- **Toys** - Your dolls, cars, and balls cannot eat or grow
- **Furniture** - Chairs, tables, and beds don't breathe
- **Books** - Books are helpful but not alive
- **Clothes** - Your shirt and pants don't need food

### In Nature 🌍

- **Rocks** - Rocks don't grow or have babies
- **Water** - Water is important but not alive
- **Air** - Air helps us breathe but it's not living
- **Sand** - Sand at the beach cannot eat or move by itself
- **Mountains** - Mountains are big but not alive

### Things Made by People 🏗️

- **Buildings** - Houses and schools don't breathe
- **Cars** - Cars can move but only when people drive them
- **Computers** - Computers are smart but not alive
- **Pencils** - Pencils help us write but they're not living

## Can Non-living Things Move?

Yes! Some non-living things can move, but they don't move by themselves:

- A ball moves when you kick it
- A car moves when someone drives it
- A kite flies when the wind blows it
- A toy moves when you play with it

:::tip The Big Difference
**Living things** move by themselves.
**Non-living things** need help to move!
:::

## Are Non-living Things Important?

YES! Non-living things are very important:

- **Water** keeps living things alive
- **Air** helps us breathe
- **Rocks** make soil for plants
- **Sunlight** helps plants grow
- **Toys** make us happy!

Even though they're not alive, we need non-living things!
