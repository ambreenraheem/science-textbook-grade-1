### How It Works
1. When your side faces the sun = DAY
2. Earth keeps spinning
3. Your side turns away from the sun = NIGHT
4. Earth keeps spinning
5. Your side faces the sun again = DAY

### Like a Spinning Top!
Imagine you are standing on a spinning top:
- Sometimes you face a lamp (that's day!)
- Sometimes you face away from the lamp (that's night!)
- The top keeps spinning, so it keeps changing!

## The Sun Never Stops Shining!
