# Parts of a Plant

Plants are made of different parts. Each part has a special job! Let's learn about them!

## The Main Parts of a Plant

### Roots 🌱

Roots grow underground where we cannot see them!

**What roots do:**
- Drink water from the soil
- Hold the plant in the ground
- Take nutrients from the dirt
- Some roots are food we eat (carrots!)

**Fun fact:** Some trees have roots as long as the tree is tall!

### Stem 🌿

The stem is like a straw that holds the plant up!

**What stems do:**
- Hold the plant upright
- Carry water from roots to leaves
- Carry food from leaves to the rest of the plant
- Some stems are thick like tree trunks!

**Fun fact:** A tree trunk is actually a very big, strong stem!

### Leaves 🍃

Leaves are usually green and flat!

**What leaves do:**
- Make food for the plant using sunlight
- Breathe in air for the plant
- Come in many shapes and sizes
- Change color in autumn!

**Fun fact:** Leaves are like the plant's kitchen - they make food!

### Flowers 🌸

Flowers are the pretty, colorful parts!

**What flowers do:**
- Make the plant look beautiful
- Attract bees and butterflies
- Make seeds for new plants
- Come in many colors: red, yellow, pink, purple!

**Fun fact:** Some flowers smell sweet to attract bees!

### Fruits 🍎

Fruits grow from flowers!

**What fruits do:**
- Hold seeds inside them
- Protect the seeds
- Can be yummy to eat!

**Fun fact:** Yes, tomatoes are fruits, not vegetables!

### Seeds 🌰

Seeds are tiny but very important!

**What seeds do:**
- Grow into new plants
- Have baby plants inside them
- Can travel by wind, water, or animals
- Need soil and water to grow

**Fun fact:** The biggest seed in the world is the coconut!

## How the Parts Work Together

Think of a plant like a team!

1. **Roots** drink water from the ground
2. **Stem** carries the water up
3. **Leaves** use water and sunlight to make food
4. **Stem** carries food to all parts
5. **Flowers** make seeds
6. **Seeds** grow into new plants!
