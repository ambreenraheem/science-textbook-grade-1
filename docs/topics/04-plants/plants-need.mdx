# What Plants Need to Grow

Just like you need food and water, plants need special things to grow big and strong! Let's find out what they are!

## Four Things Plants Need

### 1. Sunlight ☀️

Plants LOVE the sun!

**Why plants need sunlight:**
- Leaves use sunlight to make food
- Without sun, plants cannot eat
- Plants grow toward the light
- Different plants need different amounts

**Try this:** Watch how a plant in your window leans toward the sun!

**What happens without sunlight?**
- Leaves turn yellow
- Plant becomes weak
- It stops growing
- It may die

### 2. Water 💧

Plants get thirsty too!

**Why plants need water:**
- Roots drink water from the soil
- Water helps move food inside the plant
- Keeps leaves fresh and green
- Too much or too little is bad!

**How do we water plants?**
- Use a watering can
- Pour water on the soil, not the leaves
- Water when the soil feels dry
- Don't give too much water!

**What happens without water?**
- Leaves droop and wilt
- Plant becomes dry
- Soil cracks
- Plant cannot make food

### 3. Air 💨

Yes, plants breathe!

**Why plants need air:**
- Leaves take in air through tiny holes
- Air has things plants need
- Plants also give us fresh air back!
- This happens all day long

**Fun fact:** Plants breathe in what we breathe out, and breathe out what we breathe in! We help each other!

**What happens without air?**
- Plants cannot make food
- They cannot grow
- They become sick

### 4. Soil 🪴

Soil is plant food's home!

**Why plants need soil:**
- Roots grow in soil
- Soil holds water for roots
- Soil has yummy nutrients
- Keeps the plant standing up

**What is in soil?**
- Tiny pieces of rock
- Dead leaves
- Water
- Air pockets
- Little bugs that help!

**What happens without good soil?**
- Roots cannot grow well
- Plant cannot stand up
- Not enough nutrients to eat

## How a Seed Grows

Let's watch a seed become a plant!

### Step 1: Plant the Seed 🌱
- Put seed in soil
- Cover with a little dirt
- The seed is sleeping!

### Step 2: Add Water 💧
- Water the soil gently
- Seed starts to wake up
- Something is happening inside!

### Step 3: Seed Opens 🌿
- A tiny root grows down
- A tiny stem grows up
- Breaking through the soil!

### Step 4: Leaves Appear 🍃
- First two baby leaves pop up
- They are called seed leaves
- Plant starts making food!

### Step 5: Plant Grows 🌻
- More leaves appear
- Stem gets taller
- Roots grow deeper
- Flowers may bloom!
